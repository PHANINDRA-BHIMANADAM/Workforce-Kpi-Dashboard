## Problem Statement
In modern organizations, workforce analytics is essential for understanding key metrics such as employee attrition, job satisfaction, and departmental performance. Without actionable insights, HR teams face challenges in addressing high attrition rates, balancing employee satisfaction, and improving financial outcomes across departments.

This project tackles these issues by building a Workforce KPI Dashboard, providing HR professionals with critical insights through visualizations and KPIs derived from a dataset.

## Solution
**We developed a Workforce KPI Dashboard using Python and interactive libraries to:**

-Analyze workforce data, including attrition rates, job satisfaction, and departmental income.

-Provide actionable insights through customized Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

-Visualize key trends to support strategic HR decision-making.

-This dashboard is built in Google Colab, allowing easy implementation and reproducibility. The project uses a workforce dataset to demonstrate its capabilities.
